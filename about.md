I grew up in Lindesberg, Sweden and moved to Linköping to study at 18. I study computer science and engineering at Linköping University, currently doing my master with a focus on machine learning.

Throughout my time in Linköping I have had some work experience both in industry and helping out with teaching at the university.
I find teaching very rewarding and meaningful.

In 2018-2019 I spent a year as an exchange student at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
This time was very valuable for me and offered many new insights.

I am an avid Linux user and a believer in free and open source software. Openness of ideas, culture and research is very important to me.

I am currently working on my master thesis at the Division of Statistics and Machine Learning at Linköping University.
