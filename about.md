I grew up in the fairly small Swedish town of Lindesberg, but moved to Linköping to study at 18. I study computer science and engineering at Linköping University, currently doing my master with a focus on AI and machine learning.

I am an avid Linux user and a strong believer in free and open source software. I like DIY ideas both in general and for software. Openness of ideas, culture and research is very important to me.

<br>
Even though I have always been a full time student I have had some work experiences more or less related to my fields of interest. Some of the most interesting has been working as a course assistant at the University. I've worked with seminars, lessons and assignments for courses in mathematics and computer science. I find teaching very rewarding since it both allows you to further cement your own knowledge within an area as well as seeing the students approve and appreciate new knowledge.

### Current interests
These are some things that I am interested in and/or work on at the moment. I try to keep this as up to date as possible.

* Fundamentals of Neural Networks
* GNSS positioning
* Linux
